  content: `Hello friend,

It's been a while since I last wrote to you. The last letter I wrote, I never completed. It seemed so stupid- once I sat down to write, it felt like I had nothing to say. I still don't. But I want to talk to you.

I've changed a lot since you last knew me. I doubt you would recognise me anymore. Where do I start? I went to college, it's almost over now. My mom changed cities. I've practically moved out of my home in Chennai. Oh, and I got a job. Life feels so different.

College was especially kind to me. I wish you were there. But even without you it was the one place I didn't feel empty. Alone. In fact, it's perhaps the reason it took this long for me to rewrite that letter I never finished. I made some amazing friends. People I grew closer to than perhaps anyone else I have ever known. Closer perhaps, than even my family. You remember how we shared a general distaste for our homes and our parents? I've grown out of that now. Or maybe they have just gotten cooler. You should give them a chance too. Who knows?

Anyway, I digress. I never had problems making friends, you know that. But the friends I made in college are like nothing I have ever known. Some of them are funny. Some of them are smart. Some like poetry, some like art. Some of them like to dance, what a weird thing to do. Though most of them are nerds, like me and you. Got a bit creative there :)

All of them are kind.

And yet, none of them remind me of you. The way you spoke, your small little obsessions, the writing. And your competitive streak. I remember the car ride to the KVPY centre in 11th grade. We were studying diseases and the name of the microbe that caused them. We didn't even study biology. We just wanted to see who could remember the most. You were so mad I won, you challenged me again just before the exam. I also remember how we sometimes used to read together, and you always tried to be the one to ask for the next page. Did you even read the whole thing? I would quiz you sometimes, shocked to find you always did. You forced me to read faster. And don't even get me started on football. You were a dirty defender, I will say that much.

We had such a casually mundane relationship. For years, we sat together in school. 7th to 10th? No, the teachers would eventually separate us towards the end of the school year. They were so self righteous, of course they knew what was best for us. Besides, we had the rest of our lives to keep talking to each other, eh? But only so much time to learn. There was FIITJEE too, we had classes till 8:30, remember? I remember your mother telling me how you almost stopped speaking Tamil at home after meeting me. Did I really mean that much to you? Sometimes, I like to pretend I didn't. It's too much pressure, you see. But that is quite sad in its own way.

We then changed schools together. Just before the first lab class, you were talking to this girl from our class. I teased you so much after. You didn't mind the retorts somehow, I think someone was in a good mood. Not like there was anything you could have said back either. You always thought you would just get married off to someone and that would be the end of that. You also thought it was for the best, and that you had more important things to do. I used to fight you on that. I wonder if you still think that way. I could never.

I got into a relationship in college. I told you I would. Two, in fact(girlfriends, in case you were wondering). The first one you would have hated at first. I can so easily imagine you getting irritated with her. Infuriated, even. I'm sure she would say stupid stuff just to annoy you. But she's a nice person, you'll see. The second one you would have loved. She's an amazing writer, but nothing like you. You were far less…..girly? I'm sorry for my grotesque descriptions, but you remember how I always liked to keep things simple. It was while dating her that I started trying to write again. At first just for her, then because I enjoyed it. In many ways, I would never have started a blog if it weren't for her. And yet, when I finally did, the first person I thought of was you. Forgive me for the cringe, but it has always been you.

I thought about how we were both so eagerly waiting for the Blood of Olympus, only to be utterly disappointed. And don't even get me started on The Cursed Child. I remember how our Hindi teacher took away our books in class, though I can't remember which books they were. And I remember us discussing book ideas on end. Do you remember there used to be a story writing section in English? Once, you wrote a piece completely disregarding the word limit about some portal to another world. What prompt justified that story, I still can't remember. The story started with the protagonist at the cave of the portal, a short flashback in between, and ended with a dialogue about said portal. It was completely plotless, pointless, with the pacing of a fantasy novel ridiculously unsuited to the short story medium. It was like the first few pages of the first chapter of a very long book. Why couldn't you just write a simple story? Bunty went out, made a mistake, learnt his lesson, the end? The teacher still gave a 7, further proof that they never read a thing we wrote. You said you would continue the story later, and you did try, like with a lot of other stories. But you always wanted to write this extravagant story, filled with lore and twists and could never see out a single one. It's almost poetic. Well, every good story has foreshadowing, doesn't it?

Although to your credit, I never completed the book I had started to write either. I guess that's all our friendship amounted to, a bunch of unfinished stories.

I have this core memory, something I keep replaying. The first day of 12th, I came back after camp, and you came to check which classroom I was allotted. There was supposed to be a reshuffling exam that I missed, and there was still some confusion over what needed to be done. I keep seeing this picture of you, with your eyebrows raised, when you saw me seated in the first batch. That day at lunch was the last time I saw you. Should I have known? 'Everything comes easy to you', you said. Well, I guess not everything.

When you jumped, you put your glasses aside first. The cameras showed you take it off slowly, after much contemplation, fold it, and gently place it on the railing. And this is one detail I simply cannot wrap my head around. Forgive me, but I fail to understand-

What did you see in those glasses that you didn't see in yourself?

Sigh

What the fuck am I supposed to do with those glasses?

My mom made those glasses for you. For my friend.

She reached the hospital first. Your parents lived further away, after all. She told me on the phone that you had an accident, but I only learnt the truth that night. You see, I never actually saw you in the hospital. I was still in school, and to this day I thank God for that. For it wasn't a painless death, this I'm sure you remember. And I heard that when you finally passed away, your mother balled her eyes out, screaming and confused. She was completely unintelligible. Inconsolable. She told everyone that she knew you would come back, because she packed your lunch for you, and so you just had to come back. I doubt she knew what she was saying herself.

I wonder, if you were there, would you give her that much? Or point out that the lunch had nothing to do with it? The last lunch she would ever pack.

When I visited your parents later, your mother held my hands.

I didn't cry. I felt like it, but I couldn't. I don't know why.

My dad shared your father's sentiments. What could have gone so wrong? Your life was fine, good even. How did any of the things you cared about matter? But I disagree. You see, happiness is a gift. It's a gift you give yourself, every second of your existence, but it's a gift you must be grateful for nonetheless. You won't understand it, and you definitely can't take it for granted. Because that's a part of the giving. I don't know. Perhaps I'm not making sense. I'm still figuring it out, you know?

I will admit, I have thought about you a lot. More than I have even acknowledged to myself. There was a time when I held you on my head. Like an ornament. Or a reminder. It felt weird being happy without you. Sadness felt like a necessary part of grief. Like I had to prove to myself that I'm missing you, or something just as stupid along those lines. I've grown out of that. But even now that I'm happier, scarcely a day goes by where I don't think of you, at least once. Sometimes, I imagine it all being too much for me. Not because it feels like too much, things keep getting better. But because of this thought that a breakdown would be some kind of validation of my feelings for you. It hasn't happened. Yet, I know that you changed me. Sometimes, people call me mature. For not getting stressed, or upset, or hurt. What do they know, it's not maturity, it's detachment. What's an insult in the face of loss? What's a breakup in the face of death?

I have two pictures of you, outside of the newspapers. Both of them are stuck in a room in an apartment I no longer call my home. In neither of them are you smiling. I still remember your smile, faintly. But I cannot, for the love of me, remember your laugh. What was your laugh like? It wasn't loud, I'm sure. I like to imagine it was a silent chuckle. And every now and then, it would turn into an uncontrollable cacophony of weird noises and grunts.

Honestly, I remember so little of you that I'm not sure what it is I think about when I think of you. Not the person, surely. Perhaps a projection? Or a wish?

I like to imagine the two of us laughing together sometimes, though I'm not sure at what. Perhaps your glasses, fallen a few stories down.

Or the stories we could never complete.

I thought about writing to you before. But like I said, it felt so stupid. It felt like I had nothing to say. The truth is, I really don't. But I don't think conversations are about saying things, really. Not anymore.

Until next time,

Abhinav`
