					Hi mama,<br><br>

There is something I read somewhere, about the time we have left with people. It got me thinking. How much longer do you think we all have to live? Maybe 30 years together? It feels like a long time doesn't it? But it's not. Because if I only visit you once every 2 years, that's 15 visits. 15 visits until I will never see you again. It's not enough, I have to visit you more often, spend more time while I can. But how much more can I push it? 30 visits? 60? What is the difference then, between having 30 more years, or 30 more weeks? It's never as much as we think it is. And we can’t make up for lost time, no matter how hard we try.
<br><br>
Thats quite a morbid start to this peace. Let me go back a bit. 
<br>We had our issues, no doubt. For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to do my own thing. I never liked being shackled. And you were protective. Very, very much. Things have changed now of course. I’ve grown up, truly on my own, and I have started to see things differently. I won't say something cliche, or that it was all for the best in the end. Besides, there were times we were both right in our own ways. Regardless, I have finally begun to appreciate just how tough your life has been, and just how much you have sacrificed. I am sorry it has taken so long.
<br><br>
Everyday, you packed my tiffin for me. You woke up hours before your work started, just because I had to go to school. I can barely even bring myself to wake up for work most days. And your work wasn't easy either. You sent me to all sorts of different classes. Of course I didn't appreciate all of that, I was just a kid after all. But you had to make sacrifices for that as well. And I would be lying if I said I am not reaping the benefits of it now. You sent me to my tournaments, whatever events I participated in, and supported me no matter what. I am truly sorry I never showed you the gratitude for this that you deserved. I was always bitter about something or the other. Especially as I became a teenager, there were days I wouldn't come out of my room at all. We fought over this as well, of course, with every fight turning me more distant. No wonder I had no idea about the troubles you faced, I was too self absorbed to even care.
<br><br>
You always had your issues with papa, especially as I grew older. But you tried not to take it out on us. You asked me recently if that ever had any effect on me and Sid. But what can I even say? For the most part, you took it all in silence, and I never asked. It doesn’t surprise me at all that even through all that you were only concerned about us. But it fills me with shame, why was I never concerned about you?
<br><br>
When you had your disc collapse, you were bedridden for several months. You told me recently that you have never felt more alone than you did then. No one helped you, not the way you wanted. You hated my father for doing his own thing, living his own life. It makes sense of course, no one deserves apathy. But why did you forgive me for it? Was I not far worse? What did I ever do for you back then, but take the excuse to spend even more time in my room without being chastised. You sometimes say you are proud of me, but it makes no sense that I should be someone to be proud of. Only blind love could have kept you from seeing something so painfully obvious. Even during my 12th, you waited until after my JEE was done to have your procedure. Why won't you just prioritise your own health? When you finally left Chennai, you were all over the place. Struggling with surgeries, the burden of a new job, and moving Sid to another city. You left papa to reunite with a family you could never even be truthful to. And you did it all alone. Actually, not quite alone. This was the first time you ever confided your fears to me, as I was leaving for college. It was the first time I saw you vulnerable. Actually, the first time I saw you at all.
<br><br>
While I sometimes wish you had confided your troubles to me even as a child, that I was shielded from all of this for years is probably a blessing in itself. Seeing your parent cry, over and over again, isn’t an easy thing after all. 
<br><br>
You told me recently, that a few months after I was born, you even considered quitting your job. I was shocked to hear this. I cannot imagine you without your work, and I don't think you can either. The fact that you even considered it…it's hard to think about. Papa told me you used to cry every time I got sick, and honestly I was more sick than healthy back then. You would leave me in creche during work, and you hated yourself for it. You blamed that for all of my health issues as a kid. And so naturally, you blamed your job as well. Another thing I learned recently is how when you left home, it was without your parents blessing, to pursue a career in Chennai. You left your life, your engagement, and your family with nothing but your own savings to go to some unknown city where you were all alone. You did all of that for your career. And you were willing to leave that for me. Did I really mean so much to you? More than every other part of your life combined? This is one sacrifice I am glad you didn't make. There is a lot that goes into raising a child, and I wouldn't be the person I am today if my mother weren't as strong as she is. 
<br><br>
Today yet again, you live a lonely life. You have family in Chandigarh, but it doesn't quite feel right after all this time, and especially with the history. You have said this yourself. And work is work. You come back home so tired to do anything, but you have to still be there for Sid. I look at Siddharth, now a teenager, and see in him the same kind of anger that I used to have. He doesn't always treat you right, and this reminds me more than anything else that I didn't either. But you are more patient with him, perhaps because of my experience. And you keep giving, expecting nothing in return. How could you have time for anything else? I never saw this side to adulthood before, but I sometimes wonder, am I heading down the same path? Will I too, 30 years from now, have kids who barely visit and no friends to keep me company?
<br><br>
I don't know when it was that I first started seeing you for who you truly are. The first few times you really opened up to me, I tried to give you advice. How pretentious. To think I could solve anyone’s problems when I had only just developed the maturity to even empathize in the first place. But I don't think you need someone to solve your problems. You always figure out a way, one way or another. And you don't need anyone to acknowledge it either, because your motivations have never been like that. But I know that you are human, just like anyone else, and I have seen you doubt yourself, far more than someone like yourself should. I have seen you scared- of moving, of people, of your husband and kids, and of even yourself. And while I love you loads, if there was only one thing I could tell you, now and forever, to make you feel better when life gets hard it would be this- I am proud of you
<br><br>
When I saw your old pictures at Nanu's home, it was quite surprising. It's hard to imagine my mom being anyone other than mama after all. You were quite the stunner you know. I saw pictures of you smiling and dancing with your friends, and I couldn't help but wonder- if we met then, would we have been friends? I think so. Definitely better friends than we were for most of our lives. Forgive me for being selfish however, but I am glad that didn't happen.
<br><br>
I am glad I got you as my mom.
